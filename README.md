# cman -- c project manager

### cman is a project manager for C that is inspired by cargo for rust, it is NOT a package manager, it is only designed to automate compiling and running c
### it allows you to run, build and make new c projects, it utilizes makefile but adds some more automation

# Usage:

```bash
    # Make a new project:
    cman new projectname
    
    # run project
    cman run
    
    # build project
    cman build
```

# suggestions

```bash
    # make it executable
    chmod +x cman
    
    # move to bin folder for universal use
    sudo mv cman /bin
```
